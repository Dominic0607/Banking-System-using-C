# Banking-System-using-C
Its a Bank Management System project made using C language. It contains all the features that a bank should have from creating account to withdrawing money.  
This project is developed to nurture the needs of a user in a banking sector by embedding all the tasks of transactions taking place in a bank. 
Future version of this project will still be much enhanced than the current version.
Writing and depositing checks are perhaps the most fundamental ways to move money in and out of a checking account, but advancements in technology have added ATM and debit card transactions. 
All banks have rules about how long it takes to access your deposits, how many debit card transactions you're allowed in a day, and how much cash you can withdraw from an ATM. Access to the balance in your checking account can also be limited by businesses that place holds on your funds.
